<I> My High School days was very stressful for me, I came a lot of problems with regards to relationships,
  family, on academics and friends. But I coped up with it by doing the things that I love. I have a very fulfilling feeling about what I have been able to accomplish in my life so far. I want the absolute best for myself and those close to me. I often go above and beyond to help those around me succeed and be the best version of themselves that they can possibly be. </I> </p> </center>
