<I> On my Elementary days I was a friendly kid that has a lot of friends. I can still actually remember all of the things that I've done as a student. I was naughty, everyday I played lots of kind of games in our playground. I actually still have my scars that truly explains how playful I was when I was a pre-schooler. 
I still can remember all of my forner classmates, about the troubles that I make and in fact I can still reach them out until now whenever there is an occassion. </I> </p>
